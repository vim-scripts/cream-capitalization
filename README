A simple collection of functions (and mappings) to capitalize a selection in one of four ways:
  UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case and rEVERSE cASE.

cream-capitalize makes these F5 combination keyboard shortcuts available:

  F5           Capitalize selection, title case
  Shift+F5     Uppercase selection
  Alt+F5       Lowercase selection
  Ctrl+F5      Reverse case of selection

This is one of many custom utilities and functions for gVim from the Cream project ( http://cream.sourceforge.net ), a configuration of Vim for those of us familiar with Apple and Windows software.
